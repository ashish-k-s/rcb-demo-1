#  OpenStack networking concepts

=== OpenStack Networking Concepts ===

OpenStack provides a robust and flexible networking solution through its Neutron service, enabling users to create and manage networks, subnets, routers, and other networking components. Here's an overview of key OpenStack networking concepts:

== Networking Components ==

1. **Networks**: These represent logical isolation in the data center, providing a broadcast domain similar to VLANs in traditional networks. Each network requires a unique subnet and can be assigned different IP address ranges.

2. **Subnets**: Subnets are smaller segments of networks used to allocate IP addresses to instances. A subnet is linked to a specific network and has its own IP address range, subnet mask, and gateway.

3. **Routers**: Routers enable communication between different subnets and networks within OpenStack. They facilitate traffic routing by learning routes dynamically through protocols like OSPF, RIP, or statically configured routes.

4. **Ports**: Ports represent the connection points between instances and networks/subnets. Each port is associated with a network or trunk (described below) and can have additional attributes such as security groups and Quality of Service (QoS) policies.

5. **Trunks**: Trunks allow a single port to connect to multiple networks simultaneously, facilitating multi-tenancy and network segmentation.

6. **Floating IPs**: These are publicly routable IP addresses that can be associated with instances for external access from the internet or other networks outside of the OpenStack environment.

== Networking Models ==

OpenStack supports various networking models to cater to diverse deployment requirements:

1. **Local**: In this model, each instance connects directly to a network defined in OpenStack without requiring additional components like VLANs or VLs (Virtual Local Area Networks). It's suitable for small-scale deployments and testing.

2. **VLAN**: Utilizes VLANs to provide logical segmentation within a physical network. Multiple VLANs share the same physical infrastructure but are isolated from each other at Layer 2.

3. **GRE/VXLAN Tunneling**: This model uses GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) or VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN) tunnels to create overlay networks. These tunnels encapsulate Ethernet frames within IP packets, allowing virtual networks to span across physical infrastructure.

== Networking Services ==

OpenStack networking relies on various services for its functionality:

1. **Neutron Server**: The core service responsible for managing and provisioning networks, subnets, routers, ports, and other networking components.

2. **ML2 Plugin**: The modular layer 2 plugin that provides a framework for extending Neutron to support diverse networking technologies and models.

3. **Open vSwitch (OVS)**: A widely used software-defined networking (SDN) solution that serves as the default mechanism driver in OpenStack for implementing networking features such as VLANs, GRE/VXLAN tunneling, and security groups.

4. **L2 Agent**: Runs on network nodes and manages local networking resources, communicating with the Neutron server to provide networking services to instances.

5. **Metadata Agent**: Provides instance metadata services that allow instances to retrieve configuration details and communicate with the OpenStack environment.

== Hands-on Activity: Configuring Basic Networking ==

To solidify your understanding of OpenStack networking concepts, follow these steps to configure basic networking in your Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) lab environment:

1. **Login** to the RHOSP dashboard and navigate to **Project > Network > Networks**. Click 'Create Network' and provide a name, select an appropriate networking model (e.g., VLAN or GRE/VXLAN), and specify an IP address range.

2. **Create Subnet**: Navigate to **Project > Network > Subnets**, click 'Create Subnet', associate it with the previously created network, and provide an IP address range and gateway.

3. **Create Router**: Go to **Project > Network > Routers**, click 'Create Router', choose a name, and connect it to your existing network and subnet.

4. **Add Interface**: Under the router details, click 'Add Interface' to associate it with the desired network or subnet. This enables communication between connected instances and networks.

5. **Allocate Floating IP**: Navigate to **Project > Network > Floating IPs**, allocate a floating IP address, and associate it with an instance for external connectivity.

By completing this activity, you'll gain hands-on experience in configuring basic OpenStack networking components and better understand how they function together within the RHOSP environment.
