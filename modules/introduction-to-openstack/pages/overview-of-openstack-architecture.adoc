        :subheader: Overview of OpenStack Architecture

OpenStack, an open-source cloud computing platform, provides a robust and scalable solution for managing compute, storage, and networking resources within a data center. Its modular architecture comprises several core services and components that work together to deliver Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) capabilities. This section offers an overview of the OpenStack architecture, detailing its key components and their interactions.

### Core Services

OpenStack's architecture is built upon multiple core services or projects that handle specific functions within the cloud environment:

1. **Nova** (Compute):
   - Manages and provisions virtual machines (instances) by interacting with supported hypervisors such as KVM, VMware, and Hyper-V.
   - Provides APIs for users to create, start, stop, and terminate instances.

2. **Neutron** (Networking):
   - Manages networking services within the OpenStack cloud, including network creation, subnet allocation, and router configuration.
   - Supports various plug-ins for different networking technologies like VLANs, VXLANs, and SDN solutions such as Open vSwitch (OVS).

3. **Cinder** (Block Storage):
   - Offers persistent block storage to virtual machines through iSCSI and other protocols.
   - Enables the creation, attachment, detachment, and management of volumes.

4. **Glance** (Image Service):
   - Stores and retrieves disk images and server blueprints that can be used for creating instances.
   - Supports various image formats such as RAW, AKI, ARI, and ISO.

5. **Keystone** (Identity):
   - Provides authentication and authorization services to OpenStack projects.
   - Manages users, roles, tenants (projects), and service catalogues, ensuring secure access control across components.

6. **Horizon** (Dashboard):
   - The web-based UI for accessing and managing the entire OpenStack environment.
   - Offers user-friendly interfaces to interact with various services like Nova, Neutron, Glance, Cinder, etc., without direct API calls.

### Interactions Between Components

OpenStack components communicate via RESTful APIs over HTTP, ensuring flexibility, scalability, and interoperability:

- **Users** interact with the **Horizon Dashboard**, which acts as a single point of access to OpenStack services.
- Horizon communicates with various services (Nova, Neutron, Cinder, Glance) via their respective APIs to perform requested operations, such as creating instances or managing storage volumes.
- Keystone authenticates and authorizes all API requests between users and OpenStack components, ensuring that only authenticated users can access resources based on their assigned roles within projects.
- When users request an action (e.g., launching a new instance), Horizon forwards the request to Nova via Keystone's authentication layer. Nova then interacts with hypervisors like KVM to create and manage virtual machines.
- Neutron provides networking services, managing network connectivity for instances through its API. It communicates directly with Nova for instance placement and network configuration.
- Cinder handles block storage requests from Nova, providing persistent volumes for instances.
- Glance serves disk images required by Nova to boot new instances.

### OpenStack Architecture Diagram

A high-level diagram of the OpenStack architecture can be visualized as follows:

```
+----------------+                +----------------+                +----------------+
|    User (Horizon)|------(API)------|   Keystone      |------(Auth/Authz)|       Nova (Compute)
|                 |                |                 |                    |
|  (Image, Volume)|       +-------+   |                 +-------+        |

                               |             |               |
                               +-------------|--------------|+-------
                               |                |                |
                          +----v----+      |      +------------+ |
                          | Neutron  |------|      |    Hypervisor  |
                         (Networking)|      |        (KVM/VMware)  |
                          +--------------------+----------------+
