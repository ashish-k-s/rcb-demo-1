#  OpenStack components and services

== Introduction to OpenStack
        - Overview of OpenStack architecture
        - OpenStack components and services

OpenStack is an open-source cloud computing platform that controls large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter. It is widely used for building public, private, and hybrid clouds. The modular design allows for sequential development and easy integration with existing systems.

### OpenStack Architecture

The OpenStack architecture consists of several core services that work together to manage resources and provide APIs for interaction. Key components include:

1. **OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon):** A web-based user interface for managing and monitoring OpenStack services, enabling users to create and manage resources using a graphical interface.
2. **Identity Service (Keystone):** Provides authentication and authorization for all OpenStack services. It maintains a catalog of services, users, roles, and tenants.
3. **Compute Service (Nova):** Manages and provisions virtual machines (VMs) or instances. Users can request resources through Nova APIs and manage their lifecycle.
4. **Network Service (Neutron):** Provides networking capabilities for OpenStack environments, including IP addressing, routing, segmentation, firewalls, and more.
5. **Storage Services:**

   - **Cinder (Block Storage):** Manages block-level storage devices, providing persistent storage to compute instances.
   - **Swift (Object Storage):** Offers highly durable and available object storage for files and binary data.
   - **Glance (Image Service):** Stores and retrieves disk images and snapshots used for server deployments.

6. **Orchestration Service (Heat):** Automates the deployment and management of infrastructure resources, based on templates through a declarative model.
7. **Metering and Monitoring Services:**

   - **Ceilometer:** Collects and stores time-series data for OpenStack resources, metrics, and events.
   - **Gnocchi:** A scalable, multi-tenant database with support for time-series data, designed to store and provide access to numeric data generated by OpenStack components.

### Hands-on Activity: Exploring OpenStack Components

To gain practical experience with OpenStack components, set up a lab environment using tools like Packstack or Director (TripleO) for installation. This activity includes the following steps:

1. **Install and configure** OpenStack services on virtual machines or bare-metal servers.
2. **Access the dashboard** (Horizon) and perform basic tasks such as creating projects, users, and roles using Keystone.
3. **Launch an instance** through Nova to understand how Compute Service provisions resources.
4. **Create and manage storage**: Utilize Cinder for block storage, Swift for object storage, and Glance to upload/download server images.
5. **Configure networking**: Use Neutron to set up networks, subnets, and routers, enabling communication between instances.
6. **Explore Orchestration** with Heat by creating templates to automate the deployment of resources.
7. **Monitor resource usage** using Ceilometer and Gnocchi to visualize metrics and events over time.

This hands-on activity will provide a foundational understanding of OpenStack components and services, equipping learners with practical skills necessary for managing real-world cloud environments based on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP).
