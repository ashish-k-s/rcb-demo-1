#  Setting up a lab environment for practicing Ansible Lightspeed commands

== Hands-on Labs with Ansible Lightspeed
======================================

In this section, we'll set up a practical lab environment where you can familiarize yourself with Ansible Lightspeed commands and learn how to use them for automating system management tasks on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) systems.

**Prerequisites**

Before proceeding with the hands-on lab activities, ensure that you have access to:

1. A RHEL server or virtual machine for testing.
2. An Ansible control node (can be a separate RHEL machine or your local development environment).
3. Basic knowledge of RHEL and command-line interfaces.

**Installing necessary software packages**

1. **Update your RHEL system**: Start by updating your RHEL system to the latest packages. Open a terminal and run:

   ```
   sudo yum update -y
   ```

2. **Install Ansible on control node**: Install Ansible on your control node (which could be another RHEL machine or your local development environment). For this example, let's assume you are installing it on the same RHEL server where you're planning to manage other systems:

   ```
   sudo yum install -y ansible
   ```

3. **Install additional packages for Ansible Lightspeed**: For using Ansible Lightspeed features, install the following packages:

   ```
   sudo yum install -y openstack-ansible-lightspeed
   ```

**Configuring network settings**

To ensure controlled testing in your lab environment, you might want to configure a private network or use virtual machines and adjust firewall rules as necessary. Here's an example using `firewalld`:

1. Open the required ports for Ansible communication:

   ```
   sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ansible
   sudo firewall-cmd --reload
   ```

2. (Optional) If you're using virtual machines, configure the network settings to isolate your lab environment from other networks.

**Creating simple Ansible playbooks**

Ansible playbooks allow you to define a configuration plan or workflow in a structured and readable format (YAML). Here's how to create basic tasks for installing software and configuring services:

1. **Create a new directory** for your Ansible projects:

   ```
   mkdir -p ~/ansible-playbooks/lightspeed_demo
   cd ~/ansible-playbooks/lightspeed_demo
   ```

2. **Create an inventory file** (e.g., `hosts`) to define the target RHEL hosts:

   ```
   [lightspeed_targets]
   rhel_test_host ansible_host=<your_rhel_server_ip>  # Replace with your RHEL server IP address
   ```

3. **Create a simple Ansible playbook** (e.g., `install_software.yml`) to install the `httpd` package on your target RHEL host:

   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Install httpd package
     hosts: lightspeed_targets
     become: yes
     tasks:
       - name: Ensure httpd is installed
         yum:
           name: httpd
           state: present
   ```

4. **Run the Ansible playbook** against your target host(s):

   ```
   ansible-playbook install_software.yml
   ```

You should now see `httpd` installed on your RHEL test server, confirmed by checking its status:

```
sudo systemctl status httpd
```

**Running Ansible Lightspeed commands**

To leverage the capabilities of Ansible Lightspeed in your playbooks or ad-hoc commands, you can use the following steps as examples:

1. **Inspect system compliance**: Use the `ansible-lightspeed inspect` command to analyze a target system's configuration and find deviations from best practices or recommended settings.

   ```bash
   ansible lightspeed_targets -m ansible.builtin.setup | ansible-lightspeed inspect
   ```

2. **Get recommendations**: Use the `ansible-lightspeed recommend` command to receive suggestions for improving your systemâ€™s security, performance, and compliance based on industry best practices and Red Hat's expertise.

   ```bash
   ansible lightspeed_targets -m ansible.builtin.setup | ansible-lightspeed recommend
   ```

3. **Apply remediation**: Use the `ansible-lightspeed remediate` command to automatically apply suggested fixes or changes to your target systems, enhancing their compliance and security posture. Be cautious when applying remediations in production environments; always test them thoroughly first.

   ```bash
   ansible lightspeed_targets -m ansible.builtin.setup | ansible-lightspeed remediate --ask-yes
   ```

**Validating and troubleshooting Ansible playbook executions**

After running your Ansible playbooks or Lightspeed commands, it's essential to validate the results and troubleshoot any issues that might arise:

1. **Check playbook execution status**: Monitor the output of your Ansible playbook runs for success or failure messages.

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook install_software.yml --check
   ```

2. **Inspect task results**: Use the `--verbose` flag to get detailed output about each task executed in a playbook.

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook install_software.yml -vvv
   ```

3. **Troubleshoot common issues**:

   - Ensure proper network connectivity between your control node and target hosts.
   - Verify that required packages (like `ansible` and `openstack-ansible-lightspeed`) are installed correctly on both control nodes and target systems.
   - Double-check inventory files (`hosts`, group variables, etc.) for accurate host definitions and settings.

By following these steps, you'll have a functional lab environment set up for practicing Ansible Lightspeed commands and learning how to automate system management tasks on RHEL systems effectively.
