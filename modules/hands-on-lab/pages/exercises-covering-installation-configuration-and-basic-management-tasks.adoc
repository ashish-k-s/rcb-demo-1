#  Exercises covering installation, configuration, and basic management tasks

### Hands-On Lab: Exercises Covering Installation, Configuration, and Basic Management Tasks

#### 1. Installing Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP)

*Objective*: Learn the steps to install RHOSP using Director, the official OpenStack deployment and lifecycle management tool for RHOSP.

**Prerequisites**:
- A compatible Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) server environment with necessary subscriptions.
- Sufficient resources: CPU, memory, and disk space as per [official RHOSP sizing guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/16.2/html/director_installation_and_usage/planning-your-overcloud).

**Steps**:
1. Prepare the undercloud (the control node) by installing required packages and configuring network settings.
   - Install `openstack-tripleo-puppet` package using `yum`.
  2. Configure the `undercloud.conf` file with details like administrative email, DNS, and other parameters.
3. Prepare the overcloud (compute, storage, and network nodes) by registering them to the undercloud and enabling necessary repositories.
4. Deploy the overcloud using the `openstack overcloud deploy` command with custom configuration files (`overcloud-baremetal-expanded.yaml` or similar). Monitor the deployment process through the `/var/log/containers/stdouts/` logs.

**Verification**:
- Access the OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon) via a web browser using the public IP of your overcloud node, and ensure you can log in with the admin credentials.

#### 2. Configuring RHOSP Networking

*Objective*: Learn to create networks, subnets, routers, and ports for connecting instances to the outside world or amongst themselves.

**Prerequisites**:
- Access to the OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon).
- Basic understanding of networking concepts like VLANs and subnetting.

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to **Project > Network > Networks**. Click 'Create Network' and provide a name, CIDR, and optional description. Select a suitable network type (e.g., Flat or VLAN).
2. Create a subnet for the newly created network by clicking 'Create Subnet', providing a name, network CIDR, gateway, and DNS.
3. Navigate to **Project > Network > Routers** and create a router using 'Create Router'. Attach the previously created network's external (public) subnet to this router.
4. Add an interface to the router for connecting to the local (private) network or specific instances via floating IPs.
5. Create ports as needed in the **Project > Network > Ports** section, associating them with instances or directly with networks/subnets.

**Verification**:
- Launch a new instance and assign it to one of the created networks/subnets to ensure network connectivity.

#### 3. Managing Storage in RHOSP (Cinder, Swift, Glance)

*Objective*: Learn to create, manage, and delete volumes (Cinder), upload/download objects (Swift), and manage images (Glance).

**Prerequisites**:
- Access to the OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon).
- Basic understanding of storage concepts like block storage and object storage.

**Steps - Cinder (Block Storage)**:
1. Navigate to **Project > Volumes > Volumes** and click 'Create Volume'. Provide a name, description, and select a suitable size and type.
2. Attach the volume to an instance from the instance details page under 'Volumes'.
3. Detach or delete volumes as needed from the **Project > Volumes > Volumes** section.

**Steps - Swift (Object Storage)**:
1. Navigate to **Project > Object Store > Containers**. Click 'Create Container' and provide a container name.
2. Upload objects to this container using the Swift client or any S3-compatible tool like `rclone`.
3. List, download, and delete objects as needed within the container.

**Steps - Glance (Image Service)**:
1. Navigate to **Project > Images > Images** and click 'Create Image' to capture an instance's state as an image. Provide a name and description.
2. List, download, and delete images as needed from this section.

**Verification**:
- Verify successful operations by checking volume attachment status on instances, object listings in Swift containers, and image availability in Glance.
