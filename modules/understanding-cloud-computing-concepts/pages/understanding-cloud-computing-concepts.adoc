= Understanding Cloud Computing Concepts

Cloud computing is a technology that enables on-demand access to shared configurable computing resources over the internet. It offers benefits such as cost savings, increased productivity, speed and efficiency, and accessibility. The main service models are:

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Provides virtualized computing resources via the internet.
- Platform as a Service (PaaS): Delivers hardware and software tools over the internet for application development.
- Software as a Service (SaaS): Allows users to access applications stored on a remote cloud network.

This foundational knowledge is crucial for understanding the OpenStack platform's structure and services.
